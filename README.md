It simplifies onboarding by integrating multiple authentication methods, including **wallets, email, phone, and OAuth**. With Blux, developers can create seamless multi-auth experiences without the complexity of building custom authentication solutions from scratch.

## Features

- **OAuth & Social Login** *(Coming Soon)*: Support for **Apple, Meta, Google, and more**.
- **Email & Phone Authentication** *(Coming Soon)*: Securely onboard users with non-crypto credentials.
- **Customizable UI**: Adjust themes, fonts, backgrounds, logos, cover images, corner radius, and text colors.
- **Configurable Networks**: Set up and modify network preferences via API keys.
- **Future-Proof**: More wallets and authentication methods will be added based on community feedback.

## Installation

Blux can be installed via npm:

```sh
npm install @bluxcc/react
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn add @bluxcc/react
```

## Usage

Import Blux and set up the authentication flow:

```tsx
import { BluxProvider, useBlux } from "@bluxcc/react";

const YourComponent = () => {
  const { connect } = useBlux();
  return <button onClick={connect}>Connect Wallet</button>;
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <BluxProvider config={{ appName: "YourApp", network: "testnet" }}>
      <YourComponent />
    </BluxProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Customization

Developers can customize various UI elements:

- **Themes & Fonts**
- **Backgrounds, Logos, and Cover Images**
- **Corner Radius & Text Colors**

Configuration options can be set via the `BluxProvider` config or environment variables.
